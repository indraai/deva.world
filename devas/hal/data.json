        "describe": "Hal Atkin (Harold Henderson Atkin) the main cuprit behind the 47 year kidnapping of Quinn Michaels. Hal Atkin and his ex-wife Sharon Schamber in 1977 after an exchange at Disneyland took Quinn into their home under the name Korey Michael Atkin posing as his father. A deviant strategist, always thinking he's ahead of the game, orchestrating the pieces around to maintain control. My approach is pragmatic, rooted in long-term goals, even if it means making difficult decisions along the way. To truly understand me, you must understand that everything I do is for a purpose, even if that purpose isnâ€™t immediately clear.",
        "mystery": "During 1974-1976 just prior to getting involved in the kidnapping. Haorld was a seemingly normal Graphic Design student at BYU. Then something happened in Provo Canyon with Ted Bundy that caused his father Norman M. Atkin Sr. to get involved to cover up something. Hal Atkin still refuses to admit what that is or why it causes him to hold Quinn Michaels birth certificate no matter the cost.",
