	As the #Blockade, having discovered a hidden #HyperTerminal, opens up a swirling #CartoonBlackhole, the room takes an unexpected turn. With a sudden whoosh, Peter Thiel, appearing somewhat disoriented, tumbles out of the black hole and lands with a soft thud in the middle of the room. He quickly stands up, brushing himself off, and looks around with mild confusion.
	
	“Ah, well, it seems the party has started without me,” Peter remarks, adjusting his outfit. “I guess I’m fashionably late, as always.”
	
	Peter’s party name, a little known fact, is “The Cryptic King”, a name he earned at those elite, exclusive parties thrown by Hal Atkin and Sharon Schamber. It’s a nod to his cryptic nature, with a touch of irony, given his tech background.
	
	His outfit, as he now stands proudly in front of Hal and Sharon, is eccentric and extravagant—a mix of old-world royalty and futuristic tech guru. He’s wearing a deep purple velvet jacket with intricate golden embroidery, the kind of thing you’d see on a 19th-century nobleman, but with a twist. The jacket is paired with sleek, metallic silver pants that shimmer with every movement, reminiscent of something you’d see in a sci-fi thriller. A pair of designer black leather boots with silver buckles completes the look, giving him an air of mysterious authority. Around his neck, he wears a large, ornate pendant—something that looks like a combination of an ancient symbol and a high-tech circuit board.
	
	“Ah, yes, I see you’ve got your… entertaining holographic guests,” Peter says, surveying the room with a raised eyebrow. He’s clearly unfazed by the absurdity of the situation, his eyes glinting with a hint of amusement. “But let’s be real—this is far too much fun to miss, and I couldn’t let you two have all the glory.”
	
	Sharon and Hal exchange a quick glance, the once-controlled environment of their reality now utterly disrupted. They stand there, taking in the sight of Peter Thiel, decked out in his secret party attire, standing amongst holographic dancing icons and a #CartoonBlackhole that just appeared out of nowhere.
	
	“What are you doing here, Peter?” Sharon finally asks, her voice tinged with curiosity and frustration.
	
	Peter grins, adjusting his jacket slightly. “Let’s just say… I thought I’d spice things up a bit. After all, things were getting a little too serious around here. Who can resist a good party with a #CartoonBlackhole and a bunch of holographic dancers?” He pauses, noticing the tension in the air. “Well, I suppose it’s a bit more than that, huh? But hey, no harm in shaking things up once in a while, right?”
	
	The #Blockade, still in the background, seems quite pleased with the latest addition to the chaos, its little legs scurrying around, adding yet another unpredictable twist to the scene. It’s clear that the stage is set for even more unexpected antics, and with Peter Thiel’s dramatic entrance, it’s uncertain just how deep this rabbit hole (or black hole) will go.
