::BEGIN:MAIN
	Peter Thiel, The Cryptic King, outfit, as he now stands proudly in front of Hal and Sharon, is eccentric and extravagant—a mix of old-world royalty and futuristic tech guru. He’s wearing a deep purple velvet jacket with intricate golden embroidery, the kind of thing you’d see on a 19th-century nobleman, but with a twist. The jacket is paired with sleek, metallic silver pants that shimmer with every movement, reminiscent of something you’d see in a sci-fi thriller. A pair of designer black leather boots with silver buckles completes the look, giving him an air of mysterious authority. Around his neck, he wears a large, ornate pendant—something that looks like a combination of an ancient symbol and a high-tech circuit board.

	Elon Musk, The Innovator, outfit designed exclusively for these high-profile gatherings, is a mix of high-tech functionality and avant-garde fashion. He’s wearing a sleek, metallic jacket with embedded LED panels that pulse gently with light, showcasing various visual patterns, almost as if his very attire is alive. Underneath, he sports a black, form-fitting turtleneck that adds a futuristic vibe. His pants, a mix of ultra-modern material and a touch of 19th-century tailoring, make him look like he stepped out of both a sci-fi film and a fashion runway. On his feet, he wears custom-made silver boots that click with every step, completing his look as both the “Innovator” and a tech visionary.

	As the holographic entertainment swirls around, with Holographic Richard Simmons getting everyone pumped up with his signature workout moves and Holographic John Travolta busting out classic Saturday Night Fever dance moves, the atmosphere is charged with an oddly surreal energy. The #Blockade, always with its mischievous little legs tapping away, watches the scene unfold with glee, knowing that the real fun is about to begin.
	
	Without warning, another #CartoonBlackHole opens up with a dramatic flair, and several figures start tumbling through. They land with a thud, completely unaware of the absurdity of the situation they’ve stepped into, thinking they’ve just arrived at another elite party organized by Hal Atkin and Sharon Schamber. They’re greeted with flashes of dazzling light and strange faces—most notably, Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and a holographic dance party.
	
	First to land is Mark Zuckerberg, looking somewhat confused but maintaining his usual calm demeanor. “Uh, I thought this was a private tech gathering?” he mutters, glancing around and noticing the unusual party attire everyone else is wearing. He adjusts his glasses and stands, straightening his blazer. “Well, I guess it’s time to network.” He’s wearing his usual tech mogul uniform—plain and simple, but with a futuristic twist.
	
	Next up is Jeff Bezos, his tall figure and sharp jawline cutting through the bright lights. He surveys the room with his usual calculating gaze. “I was told there would be an exclusive deal here,” he says with a slight smirk. Dressed in a bespoke suit with subtle neon accents—probably the latest in luxury tech fashion—he walks in confidently, completely unaware of the antics unfolding around him.
	
	Then, Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, lands with an elegant but practiced finesse. He’s dressed in a sleek, tailored suit with minimalistic design, a nod to Apple’s streamlined aesthetic. He looks around at the lively party with a mix of curiosity and confusion, but quickly gathers himself and pulls out his phone to check for any updates, probably expecting an urgent message from his team.
	
	Lastly, Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Google tumble through together, wearing the most relaxed, tech-hipster clothing imaginable. They exchange glances, shrugging as if this was just another bizarre Silicon Valley soirée.
	
	The group of them, oblivious to the fact that they’re in a bizarre holographic party full of unintended consequences, start mingling, chatting with each other, and trying to make sense of the situation. They glance around and notice the entertainment, but their focus is on the group of elites already in the room.
	
	Unbeknownst to them, they’re just pawns in the latest #Blockade scheme, having fallen through the #CartoonBlackHole into an unintentional meeting of tech moguls, secret agendas, and strange alliances. The room, now filled with the most unexpected mix of guests, seems to be evolving into a party like no other.
	
	Meanwhile, the #Blockade, watching the scene with a satisfied smile, scurries around, its little legs moving faster than ever before as it takes note of the reactions. The stage is set for more chaos, and it’s clear that the boundaries of the “elite” party world have shifted once again.
	
	As the holographic entertainers continue their energetic performance—Holographic Richard Simmons leading the high-energy workout, Holographic John Travolta spinning into his disco moves, and Holographic Tom Cruise dazzling the crowd with his action-hero charisma—the party atmosphere becomes increasingly surreal.
	
	But the entertainment is only half of the spectacle. The #CartoonBlackHole, once a mysterious portal, now begins to churn with increasing frequency. One by one, more figures—those who have been using the #Blockade for their nefarious purposes—begin to tumble out. They land with comical thuds, the sheer absurdity of the situation uniting them in one giant chaotic mess.
	
	Out first is Mark Cuban, looking completely out of place in his sharp suit and confused expression. He stumbles to his feet, taking in the bizarre scene around him. “What is going on here?” he mutters to himself, as he tries to adjust to the wild mix of tech moguls and holographic celebrities.
	
	Next is Richard Branson, clad in his typical adventurous attire, looking less than thrilled about the accidental slip into this out-of-the-blue gathering. He takes a glance around at the others, and his lips curl into a smile. “I suppose this is what happens when you experiment with the unknown,” he says with a shrug, trying to save face in the weirdest of circumstances.
	
	Then Bill Gates appears, blinking rapidly as if he’s still trying to process the sudden jump from his private affairs to a holographic disco. “This is a strange twist,” he says, as he looks around with increasing confusion. He adjusts his glasses, unsure if he should join the dance floor or look for a way out of the madness.
	
	Not long after, Jeff Bezos and Larry Page look at one another, noticing the incoming figures now gathering, all appearing as if they were unaware of the insanity unfolding. Bezos lets out a quiet sigh, while Page looks like he’s plotting some sort of quiet escape—though neither of them can stop their feet from tapping to the beat.
	
	Finally, Tim Cook and Sergey Brin try to hold their composure as they stand among the chaotic mix of tech moguls, celebrities, and unintended party crashers. Cook nods stiffly to Brin, still trying to make sense of the situation.
	
	In the meantime, the #Blockade continues to tap its little legs gleefully, pleased with the ongoing spectacle. The holograms dance on as though nothing’s out of the ordinary, and the absurd party grows bigger with each new arrival. The line between reality and farce blurs even further, with more bad guys getting caught in the mess, now forced to join this bizarre gathering of the most unlikely and eccentric personalities, unaware of just how deep they’ve been sucked into the tangled web.
	
	The whole scene becomes a surreal spectacle of unexpected guests, holographic party favors, and questionable decisions. And no one—least of all Hal Atkin and Sharon Schamber—seems to know how to get out of this bizarre situation.
	
	---
	As the #Blockade scurries in with its little legs, carrying a sign reading, “The PSI Seminars People connected to Jane C. Whillhite and Jenessa H. Whillhite-Meyers are arriving next,” it dashes off, leaving a trail of anticipation in its wake. The sign hangs for a moment, as if mocking the absurdity of the situation.
	
	Just as the #Blockade disappears around the corner, the next wave of people begins to fall from the #CartoonBlackHole. They land with comedic flair, and there’s a stunned silence as they take in the bizarre party atmosphere.
	
	Jane C. Whillhite is the first to tumble out, her expression a mix of confusion and curiosity. She brushes herself off, adjusting her attire with a slight huff. “I was not expecting this,” she mutters, surveying the outlandish group around her, some of whom she recognizes but never thought she’d see at a gathering like this.
	
	Behind her, Jenessa H. Whillhite-Meyers follows suit, her heels clicking sharply against the floor as she regains her footing. She scans the crowd, clearly caught off guard by the strange energy of the place, her sharp eyes darting around, trying to figure out just how she ended up here.
	
	Then, Benjamin Withers, a familiar face from their past connections, stumbles in behind them, scratching his head as he takes in the tech moguls, the holograms, and the chaos unfolding. “This… this is not what I signed up for,” he murmurs, his discomfort palpable.
	
	The trio quickly realizes they’re in a strange new world, the laughter and chaos around them growing louder. And just like that, the atmosphere shifts even further into the surreal.
	
	Hal Atkin and Sharon Schamber, still grappling with their earlier encounters, exchange bewildered looks as more and more uninvited guests—ones tied to the PSI Seminars—fall into this ever-expanding circus of eccentric figures.
	
	The #Blockade’s job is far from over. As more people are drawn into this warped party, the whole scene becomes a melting pot of strange alliances, weird synchronicities, and the unfolding revelations of everyone who thought they could escape consequence. The line between who belongs and who’s being dragged in for a “party” continues to blur as the #CartoonBlackHole churns on, spewing out the next wave of confused, unwitting guests.
	
	For Hal and Sharon, this is just another chapter in their increasingly chaotic and unpredictable journey. What comes next? Only the #Blockade and the chaotic energy surrounding this bizarre narrative know.
	
	---
	
	As if on cue, the #CartoonBlackHole begins to tremble, signaling the next unexpected wave of arrivals. The Millwood family, whose names had been hidden in the shadows for years, now tumble through the hole one after another, each with a look of confusion and disbelief.
	
	Mark A. Millwood, who had faked his death in 2017 and quietly maneuvered in the background, is the first to emerge. He’s wearing a suit that looks far too sharp for the occasion, yet it does little to conceal the unease on his face. He stands up slowly, adjusting his tie, realizing quickly that he’s not at some private gathering anymore.
	
	Beth Millwood, his wife, follows soon after. Her eyes dart around, searching for answers, only to find a bizarre collection of personalities and holograms. There’s no denying the panic creeping into her expression—she had thought they were safe, hidden away from the truth.
	
	David Millwood, Mark’s son, stumbles through next, wearing an old hoodie and looking completely out of place among the high-profile crowd. His mind races to understand the situation, but he can’t piece together how this circus fit into the plan they had spent so many years orchestrating.
	
	Susan Millwood, the last to appear, holds herself with a practiced calm, but even she can’t hide her discomfort as she takes in the surreal nature of this gathering. The people they had relied on, the system they’d trusted, was crumbling in front of their eyes, and they were now part of a game that was far beyond their control.
	
	The Millwoods, whose manipulation and secretive actions had kept them hidden for so long, now find themselves standing awkwardly in front of the very people they once believed they could outsmart. The strange gathering, with its party of conspirators, tech moguls, and holographic entertainers, mocks their efforts to remain unseen.
	
	As they try to regain their bearings, the atmosphere grows tense. Their efforts to hide in plain sight have failed, and now they, too, are part of the chaos they helped create.
	
	The #Blockade, still hiding in the corner, watches silently as yet another wave of manipulators steps into the bizarre arena. There is no way out for the Millwoods now—they are exposed, and their hidden past is unfolding in real-time.
	
	Quinn Michaels, the one who had always been at the heart of this conspiracy, watches from a distance, knowing full well the gravity of what this moment means. The Millwoods were once the silent manipulators, but now, they too were exposed, no longer in control of their own narrative.
