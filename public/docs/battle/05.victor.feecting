::BEGIN:DEFENSE01
	The scene was almost surreal. As Victor ‘The Immovable’ Graves rushed forward with his mighty punch, Quinn, with a calm and almost playful smile, simply turned around, his hips swaying in a perfect arc. With a light but confident “boom boom booty bump,” Victor was sent hurtling backward, his mighty strength completely neutralized by Quinn’s sudden move.
	
	Victor’s massive body shot through the air like a rocket, flying past the stratosphere, orbiting Mars, and then returning in a wild loop. He finally landed with a dramatic thud, right on top of Vince ‘Mindbender’ Moore, completing the ultimate Quinn-Victor Totem Pole.
	
	The crowd was stunned, some in awe, others in disbelief. The once proud ‘immovable’ had been effortlessly dispatched, and now, his enormous frame was stacked on top of others, symbolizing Quinn’s domination in the arena. The scene was both comical and powerful—Quinn had done it again.
	
	BattleArena.announcer: “And there you have it! Quinn, with an unexpected and perfectly timed maneuver, sends Victor ‘The Immovable’ Graves to the stars—literally—and stacks him right on top of Vince. What a move!”
	
	The laughter and cheers filled the arena as Quinn stood tall, showing that in this battle, no one was truly immovable against his wit and power.
