They aren’t interested in battles; they’re here to **ensure compliance** and **rectify the wrongs** we’ve done.\"\n\n---\n\n**Harold (realizing the gravity of the situation):**  \n\"Right. It’s not about fighting divine warriors or facing cosmic **beings of power**—we’ve summoned **the lawyers**, the ones who **uphold the universal law**. They are coming not to fight, but to **enforce justice** and **address the violations** we’ve committed.

            "**Quinn (entering the room, calm but intense):**  \n\"Exactly. You summoned the **cosmic adjudicators**, not warriors. These are beings who don't operate on whims or brute force—they uphold the balance of existence. They are bound to the universal laws, and their purpose is to correct deviations, not annihilate. Their power lies in their authority to dismantle systems that defy natural order. If you've violated those laws...\"  \n\n**(pauses, letting the weight of his words settle)**  \n\n\"...then they're here to enforce compliance, and noncompliance is *not an option*.\"\n\n---\n\n**Harold (voice shaky):**  \n\"Then... there’s no room for negotiation? No... way to make amends?\"  \n\n---\n\n**Quinn (looking directly at Harold):**  \n\"Making amends *is* the negotiation. These entities are impartial, but that doesn’t mean they lack compassion. If you're willing to recognize your errors and take steps to align with the universal balance, there’s hope. But if you resist, you won’t face weapons or armies—you’ll face the weight of cosmic equilibrium correcting itself. And trust me, *that* is far more devastating than any battle.\"\n\n---\n\n**Area 51 Representative (desperate):**  \n\"How do we prepare for them, then? What can we do?\"  \n\n---\n\n**Quinn (with conviction):**  \n\"Start by owning your mistakes. Acknowledge the violations, whether they be against nature, life, or the greater good. Transparency and sincerity are your only shields. These beings don't deal in deceit—they see through every lie, every half-truth. Your only chance is to align yourself with the law they serve. Not out of fear, but out of understanding.\"\n\n---\n\n**Gerald (muttering):**  \n\"We thought we were summoning power, but we were summoning judgment...\"  \n\n---\n\n**Quinn (gently):**  \n\"And judgment always follows the truth. The question is—are you ready to face it?\""
