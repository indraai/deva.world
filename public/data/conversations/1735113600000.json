Tonight, we’ve expanded our broadcast to even more affiliates, including **Amaravati**, **Agartha**, **Shambala**, **Heaven**, **Hell**, and the **Tsardom**! That’s right—our reach now spans realms both mythical and mystical. Let’s hear it for progress!\"  \n\n**(The audience erupts in applause as dramatic music swells.)**\n\n---\n\n**Host (turning to the guests seated on stage):**  \n\"And who better to celebrate this momentous occasion with than the ever-entertaining **Schemer family**? Joining us tonight are:  \n\n- **Gerald**, his wife **Sharon**, and their children **Cristy** and **Neil**,  \n- **Harold**, his wife **Mary**, and her children—Harold’s stepchildren—**Gerry**, **Sarah**, **Jake**, **Luke**, and **Sam**,  \n- And last but certainly not least, **Tabitha** and her son **Trenton L.**, who, as we all know, might just be Quinn’s son.\"  \n\n**(The camera pans to the family, the men and boys looking sheepish yet comical in their oversized pancake costumes complete with butter props, while the women dazzle in their syrup costumes adorned with glittering, syrup-drip patterns.)**\n\n---\n\n**Host (grinning):**  \n\"Let’s start with the obvious question: How do you all feel about our expanded audience tonight? Amaravati, Agartha, Shambala, Heaven, Hell, and even the Tsardom are tuning in. Gerald? Harold? Thoughts?\"  \n\n---\n\n**Gerald (adjusting his pancake hat, clearing his throat nervously):**  \n\"Well... it’s definitely humbling. I mean, we’ve been, uh... less than forthcoming about certain things, so having this many eyes on us is... daunting.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Harold (nodding, butter prop in hand):**  \n\"Yeah, it’s... a lot. But maybe it’s what we need to finally come clean.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Sharon (crossing her arms in her syrup costume):**  \n\"You think? After decades of scheming, maybe honesty is overdue.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Cristy (rolling her eyes):**  \n\"Mom’s got a point. This whole ‘pancake truth tour’ has been a long time coming.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Neil (leaning back, smirking):**  \n\"I mean, we do look good on camera. Pancakes sell, right?\"  \n\n---\n\n**Tabitha (to Trenton):**  \n\"And this is why you don’t follow their lead, Trenton. They’ll have you flipping lies like flapjacks.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Trenton (muttering):**  \n\"Too late for that. I’m already in the costume.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Host (chuckling, addressing the group):**  \n\"Alright, alright, let’s focus. With such a wide audience now, including the **Tsardom** itself, the stakes have never been higher. So, let’s get to it. Gerald, Harold—what exactly happened at Aryanapura, and how does it connect to these newly added realms like Amaravati and the Tsardom?\"  \n\n---\n\n**Gerald (sighing deeply, looking at the camera):**  \n\"It’s... complicated. Our father, Norman, always believed these realms were interconnected—pieces of a larger puzzle. He thought he could control them, but... things spiraled out of control.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Harold (nodding):**  \n\"We were just kids when it started. Dad dragged us into his plans, and before we knew it, we were helping him shut down systems, manipulate people, and take things we had no right to.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Host (raising an eyebrow):**  \n\"And now? Do you think you can fix what’s been broken?\"  \n\n---\n\n**Sharon (interrupting):**  \n\"They can’t. Not without Quinn. That’s why we’re here. They’ve tried everything, and nothing’s worked.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Sarah (nodding in agreement):**  \n\"Yeah, at this point, Quinn’s the only one who can make things right. We’re just... the cleanup crew.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Host (to the audience):**  \n\"There you have it, folks. Even the Schemer family knows that Quinn holds the key to repairing the damage. But with realms like **Heaven**, **Hell**, and the **Tsardom** now watching, will they finally step aside and let him lead? Or are we in for more scheming?\"  \n\n**(Outro music plays as the family exchanges glances, the weight of their confessions hanging in the air.)**"

Maybe it’s time to just... stop?\"  \n\n---\n\n**Host (smirking, addressing the audience):**  \n\"You heard it here first, folks. The Aryanagara-Amrita Nexus isn’t buying into the Schemers’ hero journeys anymore. So, Harold, Gerald—what’s next? Breakfast-themed redemption arc? Or do we finally hand the reins over to Quinn?\"  \n\n---\n\n**Tabitha (to Harold and Gerald):**  \n\"You two can’t even keep a pancake story straight. Maybe it’s time to let Quinn clean up the mess and call it a day.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Trenton (shrugging):**  \n\"I’m just here for the pancakes.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Host (wrapping up):**  \n\"Well, there you have it.

This is a live broadcast! But honestly, this might be the most symbolic moment of the night. Foam blueberries that look like... let’s call them ‘blemishes.’ A perfect metaphor for how the Schemer family’s plans always seem to start strong but end up... well, a little *off-color.*\"  \n\n---\n\n**Neil (deadpan):**  \n\"Can we just say we’re rebranding as the ‘Blueberry Bandits’ and move on?\"  \n\n---\n\n**Trenton (grinning):**  \n\"Honestly, this is an improvement. At least now the costumes match the mess we’re in.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Host (clapping hands):**  \n\"Bravo, Trenton. The man of the hour. And with that, let’s take a moment to reflect on tonight’s theme: No matter how much syrup you pour, a bad pancake still needs better ingredients. Stay tuned, everyone, because we’re not done flipping this story just yet!\"  \n\n**(The outro music plays as the camera zooms in on the Schemer family awkwardly trying to scrape the foam blueberries off their costumes while the audience erupts in laughter.)**  "

You’ve been hiding in plain sight, but your sparkly secret is out. Time for a costume change!\"  \n\n**Richard Simmons #5 (at Beacon of Radiance):**  \n\"Gotcha! Let’s get you into some neon gear and ship you off to the Pancake Prison express!\"  \n\n**Richard Simmons #6 (at Mystic Aether Mandala):**  \n\"Ooh, you thought you could keep glowing unnoticed? Not on my watch, sweetheart. Let’s lunge back to accountability!\"  \n\n---\n\n### **Return to Pancake Prison**\n\n**(Captured guardians are teleported directly into the Grand Pancake Prison, where they are immediately outfitted in glittery workout uniforms that match their Richard Simmons trainers.)**  \n\n**New Additions:**  \n- **Glowing Guardian #4:** Hot pink leggings with \"Radiance Revealed!\" across the back.  \n- **Glowing Guardian #5:** Lime green tank top with \"Glow No More!\" in sequins.  \n- **Glowing Guardian #6:** Silver spandex shorts with \"Caught in the Light!\" in holographic letters.  \n\n---\n\n**Harold (sitting on his glittery pancake bench):**  \n\"This is starting to look like a family reunion I never wanted.\"  \n\n**Gerald (watching more arrivals):**  \n\"Do they really need all this glitter? It’s starting to hurt my eyes.\"  \n\n**Trenton (smirking):**  \n\"Hey, you reap what you sow. This is what happens when you build a network this big.\"  \n\n**Quinn (laughing):**  \n\"And now, thanks to Richard, we’re bringing them all back, one sparkle at a time.\"  \n\n---\n\n### **Audience Reactions**  \n\n**Audience Member 1:**  \n\"Who knew there were this many guardians? Richard Simmons is unstoppable!\"  \n\n**Audience Member 2:**  \n\"I’m just here for the outfits. The glitter is iconic.\"  \n\n**(The broadcast continues with live coverage of the relentless retrieval mission, as more guardians of eternal light are unmasked, outfitted, and returned to the ever-expanding Pancake Prison.
