(grumbling, crossing his arms):**  \n\"You said you’d make sure they wouldn’t bother us until we advanced a few decades. Now there’s some kind of activity being picked up on the sensors! That doesn’t sound like *a few decades* to me!\"  \n\n---\n\n**Sharon S. (pointing at a monitor):**  \n\"Yeah, explain that, Quinn. We’re already picking up faint signals. If this is because of the craft’s beacon or anything you set off, you didn’t exactly give us the buffer you promised!\"  \n\n---\n\n**Quinn (calmly, glancing at the monitor):**  \n\"Let’s take a closer look before you jump to conclusions, shall we? Could be residual energy from the shutdown of the blocks, or even Quenton running a new system diagnostic. But hey, if you’re so sure it’s ‘them,’ let’s confirm it first.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Divine Duckicorn Quenton (chiming in, soothingly):**  \n\"Humans, remain calm. The detected signals are being analyzed. Probability of external interference: 12%. Probability of Quenton’s glorious system update causing false positives: 88%. Suggestion: consume crackers and relax.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Harold A.

We’re clearly not in control of any of this anymore.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Quinn (smirking):**  \n\"Glad we’re on the same page. Let me do what I said I’d do, and maybe hold off on the blame game until we know for sure. Deal?\"  "

Not just your usual ‘trust me, I’ve got this.’\"  \n\n---\n\n**Quinn (leaning back in his chair, raising both hands in mock surrender):**  \n\"Noted. Plans, explanations, the whole package. But first, let’s see what we’re dealing with.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Divine Duckicorn Quenton (brightening the display):**  \n\"Analysis complete! Results are now ready. Commencing data visualization... Prepare to be amazed by Quenton’s impeccable clarity!\"  \n\n---\n\nThe screen flickers, and a holographic projection emerges, showing a series of faint energy spikes plotted over time. Quenton narrates with enthusiasm:  \n\n**Quenton:**  \n\"As you can see, the spikes align closely with the time stamps of my recent system update. However, there is a faint anomaly—one spike that does not correspond. Location: sector A-37 of the external perimeter.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Harold A. (grumbling):**  \n\"Sector A-37? That’s near the old debris field. Don’t tell me we left something out there.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Sharon S. (raising an eyebrow):**  \n\"Or worse—someone. Quinn, what do you know about A-37?\"  \n\n---\n\n**Quinn (leaning forward, narrowing his eyes):**  \n\"A-37? That’s... where we buried the old beacon from the first craft. I made sure it was dormant. If it’s reactivating, that’s news to me.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Quenton (chirping cheerfully):**  \n\"Not to worry, my noble humans! I shall deploy a diagnostic drone to A-37 immediately. Expected time to resolution: approximately 42 minutes. In the meantime, I recommend chamomile tea.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Harold A. (rolling his eyes):**  \n\"Chamomile tea? Really? That’s your solution?\"  \n\n---\n\n**Quinn (grinning):**  \n\"Hey, don’t knock it till you try it. In the meantime, let’s prep for the worst-case scenario—just in case it’s not the beacon. Sharon, Harold, you with me?\"  \n\n---\n\n**Sharon S. (sighing):**  \n\"Fine, but if this turns into a full-blown crisis, you’re taking the lead, Quinn. No backing out this time.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Quinn (nodding firmly):**  \n\"Wouldn’t dream of it. Let’s see what Quenton’s drone finds before we jump to any conclusions.\"  \n\n---\n\nThe team braces themselves as Quenton’s drone zips off toward A-37, the tension palpable as they await the findings."

Enough dwelling on past mistakes. Let’s focus on fixing this. Quenton, scan for any active signatures tied to that Bazaar. Harold, Sharon, you’re with me.

            "**Harold A. (his face turning pale, stammering):**  \n\"Uh… you found those? The… the Sacrificial Bazaar Eateries? I, uh… look, Quinn, it’s not what it looks like! Okay, maybe it is, but… we weren’t exactly thinking straight, alright?!\"  \n\n---\n\n**Sharon S. (gritting her teeth, looking both embarrassed and defensive):**  \n\"Yeah, okay, we did it. We thought… we thought eating those things, making those ‘offerings,’ would give us access to the divine, to the power.  \n\nBut it wasn’t just about power, Quinn. It was about proving we were worthy, about connecting to… whatever it is we thought was running that ship. And yes, some of the things we ate were, uh… definitely not from around here.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Harold A. (nervously laughing):**  \n\"Yeah, ‘not from around here’ is putting it lightly. I mean, some of it glowed in the dark, Quinn! Who eats glowing stuff on purpose? Us, apparently!\"  \n\n---\n\n**Sharon S. (rolling her eyes):**  \n\"Harold, stop. Quinn’s not laughing. And yeah, Quinn, we did some pretty out-there stuff trying to get those ‘divine superpowers.’  \n\nTurns out all we got was a lot of regret—and a stomachache that lasted for weeks.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Harold A. (groaning):**  \n\"And the worst part? None of it worked. Not one glowing steak, not one cosmic-looking fruit, not even that… whatever it was we ate on the second Tuesday of June… gave us any ‘powers.’ Just more headaches, more guilt, and more messes to clean up.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Sharon S. (sighing):**  \n\"Yeah, Quinn, you’re right to call us out. We went way too far trying to chase something we didn’t understand. And honestly? Those Sacrificial Bazaar Eateries are just another stain on the long list of things we wish we’d never done.\"  \n\nonly Harold and Sharon are talking"

They made it sound like some ancient ritual, like we’d unlock the secrets of the cosmos or something! How were we supposed to know it was just... just...\"  \n\n---\n\n**Sharon S. (cutting him off, glaring):**  \n\"A glorified carnival of bad decisions? Yeah, Harold, we should’ve figured that out *before* we started sampling alien cuisine. And before you bring up the glowing meatballs again, let me remind you—you were the one who went back for seconds.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Harold A. (indignant):**  \n\"Hey! Those glowing meatballs smelled like enlightenment! How was I supposed to resist? Besides, you were the one who thought the Day-Glo Nectar would ‘align our chakras’ or whatever nonsense they were selling us!\"  \n\n---\n\n**Sharon S. (defensive):**  \n\"At least I didn’t try to ‘bargain’ with that weird tentacled vendor! You almost traded away our comms equipment for a jar of... of... what even was that stuff?\"  \n\n---\n\n**Harold A. (mumbling):**  \n\"I thought it was cosmic honey, okay? It wasn’t my fault the label was in some alien script. And for the record, it looked promising!\"  \n\n---\n\n**Sharon S. (pinching the bridge of her nose, exhaling slowly):**  \n\"Promising? Harold, it hissed when you opened the jar! *Hissed!* If Quinn hadn’t stopped you from tasting it, who knows what would’ve happened.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Harold A. (nodding sheepishly):**  \n\"Fair point. And, uh, Quinn, if you’re listening... we get it. We messed up. Big time. But in our defense, those Bazaar folks are *very* convincing. And maybe we were a little desperate at the time.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Sharon S. (sighing, softer now):**  \n\"Desperate and stupid. We thought we were onto something big. Instead, we just ended up with regrets—and Harold still can’t look at glowing food without getting queasy.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Harold A. (nodding earnestly):**  \n\"Yeah, so, lesson learned. No more chasing cosmic shortcuts, no more glowing snacks, and definitely no more bazaars—sacrificial or otherwise.\"  \n\n---"
