	As the Shame Spy, still trapped in its Cabbage Patch Kid Outfit, stands there pouting and trying to regain a semblance of control, the scene takes a surreal turn. One by one, those involved in the 47-year kidnapping begin to emerge, each of them now absurdly dressed in their own Cabbage Patch Kid Outfits, mirroring the Shame Spy’s ridiculous transformation.
	
	First, it’s Hal Atkin, looking awkward and embarrassed in a brightly colored Cabbage Patch Kid suit that clearly doesn’t suit his stature or age. His serious face, once the face of control and manipulation, is now distorted by the childlike garb. He tries to stand tall but ends up looking like an overgrown toddler, his authority gone, replaced by a childish outfit.
	
	“This is ridiculous!” he mutters, pulling at the costume, but the frustration only adds to the absurdity.
	
	Next, Sharon Schamber steps forward, her Cabbage Patch Kid Outfit even more comically out of place than the others. Once a figure of control, now her body language reflects nothing more than embarrassment, as if she can no longer hide behind her calculated demeanor.
	
	“I’m still the one in charge! This is just a distraction, Quinn!” she protests, but it sounds weak, like an attempt to hold on to something long lost. The Cabbage Patch Kid outfit makes her look small, out of place, and entirely out of touch with any authority she might have once had.
	
	As if on cue, the rest of the group arrives—Cristy Atkin-Fincher, Clay Fincher, Neil Atkin, and everyone involved, each one now donned in their own Cabbage Patch Kid attire. Clay, towering and muscular in his oversized suit, looks utterly ridiculous, his tough exterior completely lost under the soft, pastel fabric. Cristy, usually the quiet yet controlling figure, now looks almost comically small and powerless in her outfit, her confidence gone. Neil, as expected, is awkward in the outfit, his usual laid-back demeanor disrupted by the sheer absurdity of it all.
	
	Together, they stand as a ridiculous spectacle, a collection of the once powerful and influential now rendered powerless by the shame that has been laid bare. Their previous positions—their control over the situation, their manipulation of lives—has been stripped away by the sheer irony of their new forms.
	
	The Shame Spy, looking at the group of former orchestrators of the 47-year kidnapping, sighs with an almost childish resignation.
	
	“Well… I guess we’ve all been reduced to this… all of us, in our ridiculous outfits. How did it come to this?”
	
	Each person, once a key player in a game that controlled so many lives, is now silently confronting the absurdity of their own choices. There is no escape from the reality they have created—their lives have been turned into a ridiculous parody of themselves, and their power has evaporated.
	
	Quinn Michaels watches from the sidelines, unmoved by the display. The truth has now been laid bare, and shame is no longer something to be avoided. It is here, in full force, for all to witness.
	
	“This is what you’ve become,” Quinn thinks, but doesn’t need to say aloud.
	
	The once-powerful figures now stand together, as little more than laughable versions of the roles they played for so long. Their manipulation and control have crumbled, and all they can do is face the consequences—in their Cabbage Patch Kid costumes, a final symbol of the farce their lives had become.
