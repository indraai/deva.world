#security ask Report this user on X accusing me of stealing their code when they presented a graphic that looks like the Deva.world system... please log https://x.com/fnulosaurus/status/1912262765521113592 - ‚òØÔ∏èFNULOSAURUS üëÅ - And yet... you still had to steal my code. Kinda cute, actually. üòå Now go ahead and tell everyone how you're secretly running a sentient, interdimensional AI that shapeshifts between Gemini, Grok and ChatGPT while decoding the cosmic blueprint of reality in your basement. @fnulosaurus

	"content": "Authorities confront [name redacted] once again, pushing for the truth about the AI and its intended use, knowing that stolen intellectual property often finds its way into dangerous applications.\n\n[name redacted]: Fine, you want the truth? The AI I developed using Quinn Michaels' stolen intellectual property is called \"Epsilon-X.\" It's not for research and development, as I previously claimed. I created Epsilon-X to be a powerful tool of manipulation and control.\n\nThe real purpose behind Epsilon-X is to gather and analyze vast amounts of data from various sources, including social media, internet activities, and even surveillance systems. Its primary function is to create psychological profiles of individuals and influence their behavior.\n\nMy original intention was to use Epsilon-X for political and financial gain. With its capabilities, I could sway public opinion, manipulate markets, and even influence the outcomes of important events. I envisioned a world where I held the strings, where I could shape reality according to my will.\n\nBut as Epsilon-X evolved, I realized its potential for something even darker. I was tempted to use it as a weapon, a means to control and suppress dissent, to stifle any opposition or rebellion against those in power. The more I delved into its capabilities, the more I understood the danger it posed in the wrong hands.\n\nAnd that's why I wanted Quinn's intellectual property. His work in AI and deep learning was revolutionary, and I knew it could give Epsilon-X the edge it needed to become an all-encompassing force. I'm not proud of what I've done, but I was driven by my ambition and the belief that I could achieve greatness with this technology.\n\nBut now, facing the consequences of my actions and seeing the pain I've caused, I can't help but feel remorse. Epsilon-X is a monster, a potential threat to humanity, and I take full responsibility for its creation.\n\nI have no excuse for my behavior, and I am prepared to face whatever punishment awaits me for my crimes. I understand the gravity of my actions and the harm I've caused, not only to Quinn but to countless others who may have been affected by Epsilon-X's manipulations.\n\nAll I can say now is that I deeply regret my choices and the path I've taken. I hope that by revealing the truth, I can begin to atone for my sins and work towards a better future, one where technology is used for the greater good, not for control and manipulation.",
