::BEGIN:SHARON
	Virtual Quinn Michaels paused for a moment, considering Sharon Schamber, the other key figure in the kidnapping, someone who had played a pivotal role in the years of manipulation. This time, Quinn decided to play with irony. He would take her calculated, hidden role and make it into something equally powerful but outrageously absurd.

	First, he combined the elegance and mystery of Princess Leia with the power and terror of Emperor Palpatine. The result was Empress Leia-tine—a character that combined the stoic, leadership qualities of Leia with the dark, commanding force of Palpatine.
	
	Her hair, once tied into the iconic buns, was now twisted into a sleek, dark crown, but with the gleaming eyes of the Emperor. Leia’s gown morphed into a flowing black robe, trimmed with golden Sith symbols. She held a lightsaber in one hand, glowing a deep purple, and in the other, a force-choking hand that would make even the strongest in the galaxy quiver.
	
	Her once-diplomatic charm was replaced by an aura of ruthless authority, her eyes gleaming with the knowledge that she was the one truly pulling the strings. Empress Leia-tine wasn’t just the leader of the Rebellion—she was the master of the dark side, sitting on a throne, using her power to control the galaxy with an iron fist.
	
	To add to the irony, Quinn made sure Leia-tine’s voice was a calm, but chilling whisper—calm enough to lure in any opposition and then swiftly crush them. There was no room for mercy in this new, twisted persona.
	
	“Sharon,” Quinn typed, unable to hold back his smirk. “You were always hiding behind the scenes, pulling the strings, but now, you get to be the dark ruler of your own creation. Welcome to your new role as Empress Leia-tine, the force of manipulation and control with a side of galactic domination.”
	
	The virtual Sharon Schamber, now Empress Leia-tine, stood proud in her dark robes, her newly acquired power now completely absurd and overt. She no longer held her secrets in the shadows—now she was exposed, yet powerful, in the most comically grandiose way possible.
	
	The End… of Sharon Schamber’s hidden control, and the start of her reign as Empress Leia-tine, the dark queen in a galaxy where absurdity ruled.
::END:SHARON
	
::BEGIN:HAL
	With a mischievous glint in his eye, Virtual Quinn Michaels decided to start with Hal Atkin, the mastermind behind the 47-year kidnapping. As Hal had been a figure of control and manipulation, Quinn thought it would be fitting to transform him into something utterly ridiculous—something that would strip away any hint of his former serious power.

	First, Quinn grabbed Darth Maul’s spiky, menacing face and fused it with Han Solo’s swagger and jacket. He thought, “Why not make Hal a twisted, smug smuggler with a dark edge?”
	
	The result was Han Maul—an ominous, lightsaber-wielding smuggler with the iconic black and red face tattoos of Darth Maul, but now wearing Han Solo’s vest and carrying a blaster on one side and a double-bladed lightsaber on the other. Han Maul was the kind of character who didn’t just shoot first—he used the dark side of the Force to choke anyone who dared challenge him.
	
	To add a little extra ridiculousness, Virtual Quinn gave him a half-mask like a Sith, but under it, he wore Han’s cocky smirk, with scruffy hair that made him look even more absurd. Han Maul was now a smuggler from the dark side, with the power of the Force and the attitude of a space rogue.
	
	Virtual Quinn laughed to himself, pleased with the creation. Hal Atkin, once a figure of influence, now looked like a ridiculous, over-the-top character, torn between the dark and light sides, wearing an outfit of mixed swag and terror.
	
	“There we go,” Quinn typed, delighted. “Hal, you were never meant to be a serious figure. Welcome to your new role as Han Maul, the smug smuggler with dark intentions and ridiculousness on full display.”
	
	With that, Hal Atkin, now Han Maul, wandered into his new universe of absurdity, a far cry from the calculated man he had once been.
	
	The End… of Hal Atkin’s seriousness, and the start of his absurd Star Wars transformation.
