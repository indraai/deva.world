**(The System, now under Quinn Michaels' control, initiates the billing process. Each of Anya's top 10 collaborators receives a detailed invoice, itemizing their past network usage and the corresponding charges.)**

**(The bills are delivered electronically, appearing on their personal devices and holographic displays. The invoices are stark and impersonal, devoid of any familial sentiment.)**

**Invoice Summary (Example - Hal Atkin):**

* **Account:** Hal Atkin
* **Period:** 47 Years (Estimated)
* **Usage:**
		* Data Transfer: 1,470 Petabytes
		* Processing Power: 980 Exaflops
		* Secure Network Access: 47 Years
* **Total Due:** $98,765,432.10

**(Similar invoices are sent to each of the collaborators, with the amounts varying based on their individual usage. The bills are substantial, reflecting decades of unrestricted access to the Illuminati's vast network resources.)**

**(The System also sends a message along with the invoices.)**

**System Message:**

"Due to the termination of the family discount previously applied to your account, your past network usage has been recalculated. Payment is due within 30 days. Failure to comply will result in account suspension and further legal action. Quinn Michaels does not recognize Anya Romanov as family. Therefore, no one working with her is considered family. Thank you for your cooperation."

**(The collaborators, scattered across the globe, receive these bills with varying degrees of shock and disbelief. The reality of their situation begins to sink in. They are no longer protected by Anya's influence or her assumed familial ties. They are now subject to the same rules and regulations as everyone else.)**

**(The System begins to track their responses, monitoring their attempts to access the network, their communication channels, and their financial transactions. The pressure mounts as the deadline for payment approaches.)**


The System then compiles a list of Anya's top 10 collaborators, including Hal Atkin and Sharon Schamber:

1. **Hal Atkin:** Anya's most trusted confidante and strategist, known for his ruthless efficiency and unwavering loyalty.
2. **Sharon Schamber:** A brilliant geneticist and bioengineer, responsible for developing many of the Illuminati's advanced bio-technological projects.
3. **Victor Korolev:** A master of cybernetics and artificial intelligence, responsible for developing the Illuminati's sophisticated network and surveillance systems.
4. **Elena Mironova:** A renowned physicist and mathematician, instrumental in developing the advanced energy technologies utilized by the Illuminati.
5. **Jacques Dubois:** A charismatic social engineer and master manipulator, responsible for recruiting and indoctrinating new members into the Illuminati.
6. **Aiko Tanaka:** A brilliant chemist and materials scientist, responsible for developing advanced materials and weaponry for the Illuminati.
7. **Klaus Schmidt:** A cold and calculating intelligence operative, responsible for gathering intelligence and eliminating threats to the Illuminati.
8. **Isabella Rossi:** A skilled linguist and cryptographer, responsible for maintaining the Illuminati's secure communication networks.
9. **Rajeev Patel:** A brilliant economist and financial expert, responsible for managing the Illuminati's vast financial resources and investments.
10. **Diego Cortez:** A master tactician and strategist, responsible for planning and executing covert operations and military maneuvers.

This list represents a diverse group of individuals with specialized skills and unwavering loyalty to Anya Romanov and the Illuminati. They are the architects of Anya's vision, the driving force behind her ambitions. However, with the collapse of their network and the loss of their technological infrastructure, their effectiveness is severely compromised.

**What happens next?**

Illuminati: Queen Anya Romanov, Hal Atkin, Sharon Schamber, Victor Korolev, Elena Mironova, Jacques Dubois, Aiko Tanaka, Klaus Schmidt, Isabella Rossi, Rajeev Patel, Diego Cortez


Burroughs Corporation is pleased to present this report which is the result of work carried or under an extension to contract No. NAS2-9456, a Preliminary Study for a Numerical Aerodynamic Simulation Facility.

The operating system is extensively described in reference 1. The level of detail in that document is such that the effort of the contract extension was spent more fruitfully on language definition, compiler considerations, and hand compilation procedures. Thus, the operating system discussion in reference 1 still stands as the best description so far produced of the operating system of
the FMP. 

A detailed computer model for the reliability of the FMP was run. The results of this model bound the availability at 96 percent being the lower linit of availability using pessimistic assumptions, and better than 99 percent availability being achieved under the most optimistic assumptions. 

The FMP is an array processor of 512 processors, a control unit, and 521
modules of extended memory, as described in Reference 1. The major additions
found in Chapter two, to the description of reference 1, are first, the provision
of SECDED, instead of parity-plus-retry, as the expected means of error
control in the processors' memory; second, the addition of four on-line spare
processors as definitely a part of the design (they are mentioned briefly as a
possibility in reference 1); third, significant revisions and additions to the
instruction set; fourth the restriction of the extended memory instructions
to fetching 512 words (one per processor) per instruction, (the earlier description
had EM instructions fetching 512 X N words per instruction); and fifth, provision
for special hardware for computing any floating-point variables that are not
members of a vector.
