# deva.world

The Deva User Interface

## Summary

The deva.world allows you to interact with various DEVA Agents and to enter the Deva World Virtual Realm. The DevaUI is easy to launch and begin to use with just a little technical knowledge of NodeJS and basic ability to change a few code files.

## Install

First you will close the repository into your desired location.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:indraai/DevaUI.git
```

After you have cloned the repository to your desired location then install the necessary components.

```bash
$ npm i
```


## Edit Client

In the data direcotry there is a client.json file that you will need to edit the values. Once you launch the system make a new client id with the `!bang` command and put that into the id of the client file. Then change the necessary information in the client file to get started.

## Launch Application

Once you have edited your `client.json` file then start the application with the `npm start` command. This will launch your server and tell you in the terminal what address and port to load the browser interface.

From here in the terminal you can interact in the shell or load a web browser with the address provided at launch.

Once you are in the system issue the `!help` command for more information on what todo next.
